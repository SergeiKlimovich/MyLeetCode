 https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/
 You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the
 ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).
 Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.
 Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.
 ==============================
Example 1:
Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water
(blue section) the container can contain is 49.
